Analysis of space
In linear linked list the space of pointers required is n (same as number of elements). whereas in doubly we require twice the size for pointers

insert
inserting in the first node
linear single , linear double and circular double takes O(1) time whereas circular single takes O(n) times




ARRAY vs linked list

array is created in stack and in heap whereas linked list is always createed in heap.
array is of fixed size whereas heap we can increase or decrease the size

array will occupy space according to the size of integer but linked list for every data extra space is required to store pointers

array is accessible easily from any random position but in linked list accessing is done sequentially.

inserting 
inserting the last elements takes constant time in array but takes O(n) times in a linked list
inserting in the first element takes o(n) times in array and constand time in linked list
in array we have to move the data to insert anywhere which is not advisable if the data is huge like some student data. in that case we prefer linked list

Delete
right side -> array- O(1)
linked list - O(n)

left side
array O(n)
linked list - O(1)

searching
in array - linear search O(n)
binary search O(log n)

linked list
linear search O(n)
binary search O(n log n)
